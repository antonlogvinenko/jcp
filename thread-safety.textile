h2. Thread safety

A class is thread safe if it *behaves correctly when accessed from multiple threads*, regardless of the scheduling or interleaving of the execution of those threads by the runtime environment, and with no additional synchronization or other coordination on the part of the calling code.

h3. Where is the problem?

Informally, *an object's state* is its data, stored in state variables such as instance or static fields. An object's state may include fields from other, dependent objects; HashMap's state is partially stored in the HashMap object itself, but also in many Map.Entry objects. An object's state encompasses any data hat can affect its externally visible behavior.

* Atomicity
Operations *A and B are atomic* with respect to each other if, from the perspective of a thread executing A, when another thread executes B,either all of B has executed or none of it has. An *atomic operation* is one that is atomic with respect to all operations, including itself, that operate on the same state.
Race conditions:
 ** Read-modify-write
 ** Check-then-act
 ** Compound actions
 ** Non-atomic 64-bit operations
* Visibility
 ** Stale data (like "read_uncommited", caches?)
 ** Reordering
 ** Non-atomic 64-bit operations
 
h3. Where is the problem?

Is an object thread safe?

| *State vs Sharing* | Not shared | Shared |
| Stateless | Yes | Yes |
| Immutable | Yes | Yes |
| Mutable | Yes | *No* |


h3. What should I do?
* Make stateless
* Stop sharing, any of:
 ** Not sharing at all
 ** Use confinement, any of:
  *** Thread
  *** Stack
  *** Ad-hoc
* If shared
 ** 3 types of objects
  *** immutable
  *** effectively immutable
  *** mutable
 ** What must be done
  *** proper construction
  *** safe publication
  *** syncrhonization (mutable)

h3. Some definitions

Immutable object:
 * state can't be modified after construction
 * all fields are final (guarantees *safe publication* -- consider it's special JMM semantics)
 * *properly constructed*

Effectively immutable object -- read-only
 
Avoding the *state escape*:
* *Properly constructing* -- an object is properly constructed if _this_ reference does not escape during construction. Examples:
 ** _this_ reference explicitly escapes -- used to register instance as a listener
 ** _this_ reference implicitly escapes -- inner class instance using _this_ class methods is passed
* *Publishing safely*: both the reference to the object and the object's state are made visible to other threads at the same time. A properly constructed object can be safely published by:
 ** initializing an object reference from a static initializer
 ** storing a reference to it into a _volatile field_
 ** storing a reference to it into an _AtomicReference_
 ** storing a reference to it into a _final field of a properly constructed object_
 ** storing a reference to it into a _field that is properly guarded by a lock_

h3. Tools at your disposal
* synchronization, locks -- atomicity, visibility
* final -- reference to the owning object is guaranteed to be visible *after* the field is initialized
* volatile
 ** not reordered operations, not cached, visible to every thread
 ** extended sematntics: write -- enter synchronized block, reading -- exiting synchronized block
 ** can points listed above be grouped as "volatile is visibility semantics of syncrhonized block"?
